# NaturalDisasterPrevention

# Idea for codefundoo++
The basic challenge is to find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses from natural disasters.

We can monitor the basic atmospheric properties like wind speed, temperature, humidity and air pressure using devices and analyse them according to our needs, compare with previous data to predict whether a natural disaster can occur or not.

## Predicting Storms and Tornadoes
The idea is to predict storms and tornadoes, so that preventive measures can be taken and losses can be averted. We can deploy some devices in some different parts of the cities that will record the above mentioned atmospheric properties and the data collected to a central system that would record these quantities.
Further we can compare the data collected to our previous dataset containing the similar elements and find a similar data corresponding to our present system.
We will store the previous dataset in terms of the properties and what level of disaster happened in those circumstances.For eg:- we can have a data in which the wind speed crossed 100kmph and the temperature dropped to 10 degree celsius, in this scenario southeast part of the city suffered a lot and few houses were also destroyed, so if our present data matches to any such data, we can give a warning in that particular part of the city.

### Impact to the people
We would be sending the details to server every few minutes, and they would be synchronised in a way such that there is not much load on the server. When a situation of tornado occurs, the message would be sent to the concerned authorities so that they can issue an alert in the region, also we can install alarms in the devices itself that would ring in case of warnings.
This can save many lives as people can relocate if the storm is about to come, they can take shelter in some other places, and they can also take some food with them. Authorities can make proper arrangements for the people and people with temporary houses can also take some prevention so that there houses do not get destroyed.
This would save many lives and property.

### Feasability
There would only be the installation costs of the devices in cities in few kms stretch. The cost of developing and maintaining the software won't be much.The data could be sent and received using satellite transmission, in this way areas with no or limited internet connection would also be able to use these devices and softwares. We would need a server to store the past data of the happenings and all the parameters that we have included in our design.This would take up some investment but that is only one time.
So, the maintainabilty cost would be only of the devices and that too minimal.
